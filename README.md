This repository contains seven different programs, each serving a distinct purpose, primarily implemented in Java, HTML, and JavaScript. The following sections provide an overview of each program along with instructions on how to run or use them.

## Program 1: Array Shuffling

### Description
Java code to shuffle an array of values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) using a custom shuffling algorithm, without relying on built-in methods. The code includes a `shuffleArray` function that implements a simple random-based shuffling approach, ensuring the array elements are shuffled randomly.

### Instructions
1. Compile and run the Java program.
2. The shuffled array will be displayed as output.

## Program 2: Roman Numeral to Integer Converter

### Description
This Java program converts a Roman numeral input into an integer without using built-in methods. It employs a HashMap to map Roman numeral characters to their respective values and iterates through the input, considering subtraction rules, to calculate the integer value. Users can input Roman numerals, and the program will display the corresponding integer.

### Instructions
1. Compile and run the Java program.
2. Enter a Roman numeral when prompted.
3. The program will display the corresponding integer value.

## Program 3: Pangram Checker

### Description
This Java program checks if a user-entered sentence is a pangram (contains all letters from 'a' to 'z). It uses a custom function, converts the input to lowercase, and iterates through the alphabet to check for each letter's presence. If all letters are found, it's identified as a pangram. The program incorporates user input via Scanner.

### Instructions
1. Compile and run the Java program.
2. Enter a sentence when prompted.
3. The program will determine if it's a pangram or not.

## Program 4: Custom Array Sorting (HTML & JavaScript)

### Description
The provided HTML and JavaScript code allows you to sort an array of comma-separated numbers in descending order without relying on built-in methods. It utilizes a custom sorting function (bubble sort) to rearrange the numbers. Users can input numbers, and the sorted array is displayed when they click the "Sort Descending" button.

### Instructions
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Enter comma-separated numbers in the input field.
3. Click the "Sort Descending" button.
4. The sorted array will be displayed on the page.

## Program 5: Custom Array Sorting Web Page

### Description
This HTML page features a title, input field, and a "Sort Descending" button. Users can input comma-separated numbers, and upon clicking the button, a JavaScript function sorts these numbers in descending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The sorted array is then displayed in the output paragraph.

### Instructions
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Enter comma-separated numbers in the input field.
3. Click the "Sort Descending" button.
4. The sorted array will be displayed in the output paragraph.

## Program 6: Basic Calculator (HTML)

### Description
The provided HTML code creates a basic calculator with a black background, yellow text, and white buttons. It features a clear display for input and output, with buttons for digits, operators, and an "AC" button to clear the display. The calculator allows basic arithmetic operations and displays results in the same field while removing button shadows and borders.

### Instructions
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Use the calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations.
3. Results will be displayed in the input field.

## Program 7: Survey Form (HTML)

### Description
This HTML form is a survey form with fields for first name, last name, date of birth, country (selected from a dropdown), and gender (select one of male, female, or other). It also includes fields for profession, email, and a 10-digit mobile number. The form performs basic validation for required fields, email format, and mobile number format, displaying alerts for any errors. Upon successful submission, it displays a summary of the entered details in a popup and allows for form reset.

### Instructions
1. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. Fill out the survey form.
3. The form will validate and display alerts for any errors.
4. Upon successful submission, a summary of the entered details will be displayed in a popup.
